                Patrice Lumumba (1925â€“1961) was a Congolese politician and independence leader who played a critical role in securing the Congo's liberation from Belgian colonial rule. He became the first Prime Minister of the independent Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1960.

                A passionate advocate for national unity and self-determination, Lumumba challenged neocolonial influences and fought for a sovereign and self-sufficient Congo. His vision and defiance of foreign interference made him a target, ultimately leading to his assassination in 1961.

                Lumumba's legacy remains an enduring symbol of African resistance against imperialism, and his ideas continue to inspire movements for justice and freedom worldwide.
